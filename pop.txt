My grandfather.. the 'Big Chief', as I liked to call him.. I'd like to talk a bit about how I remember him..

First of all, he was very proud of his years of service in World War 2 as an Air Force mechanic.  He was also very proud of his time, before the War, working in the Civilian Conservation Corps.  He often talked fondly of his times 'Out West' in Idaho and Montana.

He had four brothers: Henry, Tony, Mikey, and Walter, who he loved very much.  He was especially proud of Walter and all of his accomplishments.  And, of course, he had his wonderful wife of 70 years, Gloria, who he loved with all his heart.

They were quite the pair: riding around together and enjoying life well into their late 80s.  They had so many good times with so many of you that are here today.  They also endured many hard times: illnesses in the family, my father's, and other difficulties.  But even through all of that he was never one to be sad or depressed.  Angry once in a while, but for the most part he was always calm and happy.. enjoying the little things: a good sangwich, a good story.  I think part of that was just his character, but part of it was also because he had her.

I remember how he liked to save EVERYTHING.  He was a squirrel.  And she was the exact opposite, always wanting to throw things out to keep everything neat and organized.  Most of the time he saved things just to give them away.  One time, while he was staying up at the VA, he hounded his wife and I for months about something he wanted from his garage.  We eventually figured out that it was an old VHS recording of a movie about WW2 pilots that he wanted to give to one of the aids that was into planes.

I remember after he retired he would go down to New Brunswick a few times every week: to visit his brother Walter, then after Walter's passing, to work on the cars and buildings with me.  Gloria, having been the bookkeeper for their business, handled the finances and gave him cash to use each week.  One day, shortly after he went to stay at the VA, she was cleaning out his stuff and came upon his wallet.  In the wallet she found a secret stash of over $2,000 that he'd squirreled away.  She confronted him about it, and he said, 'Honey, I was saving it to buy you a diamond ring on our next anniversary!'

I remember how he loved the Yankees.  Even when they were terrible and in last place, I remember him watching every game.  And she might love the Yankees even more than he did.  But she's superstitious and nervous and couldn't bear to actually watch the games.  So instead she'd make him report the score to her every couple of innings.

I remember working with him down in New Brunswick.  I did all kinds of jobs and repairs that I'd never know how to do.. because he would instruct me.  The only rule was that we could never go to the hardware store or the auto parts store more than once.  Even if the store was only two blocks away and we were missing a critical tool, we had to improvise and use what was on hand.  At first this frustrated me, but later I realized that he did this just for the extra challenge.  He loved fixing things and solving problems.  For someone with very little formal education he was a great engineer.

Most of all, I remember how it felt to be part of his family when he was healthy.  He WAS the 'Big Chief'.  No matter what problems I had or mistakes I made, I knew that everything would be alright because he was there.. that he would take care of everything.  When I had my first car accident, I had my friends distract my grandmother while I went straight upstairs to tell him. Even as an adult, anytime I didn't know how to do something or fix something, I'd just ask him.. and on the rare occasions that he didn't know, he'd ask one of his brothers.

I really hope that I can be like him someday.
